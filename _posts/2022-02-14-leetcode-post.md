Good evening, everyone!

I was scrolling through instagram and I saw a video about developing your coding skills.
I won't get into the details of the video because it's hard to explain, but it was quite funny :)
Anyway, one thing they mentioned was doing 2 LeetCode problems a day; I've decided to try 
doing so from this point on.

I'm not sure how feasible 2 problems a day is, especially as I have quite a bit of uni work 
to do right now, but one a day will do for now. I'm not a wiz or anything, so I'll increase/decrease
the amount and/or frequency depending on my work load.

This post will detail my first ever LeetCode question (I'm giving you all the privilege lol).
