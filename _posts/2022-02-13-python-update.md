Today, I did the Introduction to Python by everydeveloper using the github learning lab!
It was great! I've learnt so much about github with this project and developed my python skills.

I learnt how to read and write to files. I had struggled with appending to the file at one point,
but I quickly learnt how to fix this by searching for the solution. Also, I have developed my
understanding of generating random numbers in python. 

In the end, I am quite satisfied with how the project turned out, I learnt a lot and developed
the project further by asking for user input.

In the end this is the code I produced: [link](https://github.com/viaod/python-random-quote/blob/master/get-quote.py)
Not too shabby, I hope :) 

I'm commiting to developing my portfolio now and exercising my passion for coding. 
So, I hope to find the time to use github more regularly and posting to hold myself accountable!
